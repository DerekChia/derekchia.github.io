Word2Vec is touted as one of the biggest, most recent breakthrough in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The concept is simple, elegant and (relatively) easy to grasp. A quick Google search returns multiple results on how to use them with standard libraries such as Gensim and TensorFlow. Also, for the curious minds, check out the original implementation using C by Tomas Mikolov. The original paper can be found here too.

The main focus on this article is to present Word2Vec in detail. For that, I implemented Word2Vec on Python using NumPy (with much help from other tutorials) and also prepared a Google Sheet to showcase the calculations. Here are the links to the code and Google Sheet.
